# pql Test Suite

Every subdirectory in this directory is a test.
The tests have the following files:

- `input.pql`: The input Pipeline Query Language
- `output.csv`: The expected output table for the query.
- `output.sql`: The expected generated SQL.
  Generally, this is generated by `go test -record`
  and then inspected for correctness.
- (Optional) `skip`: If a file called `skip` is present in the directory,
  the test will not be run.
- (Optional) `unordered`: If a file called `unordered` is present in the directory,
  the rows in `output.csv` may appear in any order during the query execution.

See the [`testdata/Tables` directory](../Tables/) for the tables these tests use.
